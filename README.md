Unit testing Todo App with Karma
1. Install karma `npm install --save-dev karma`
2. Start karma watcher `karma start karma.conf.js`
3. if 2 is not working try with `./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start karma.conf.js`

Thats it! it should say at the bottom `PhantomJS 1.9.7 (Mac OS X): Executed 1 of 1 SUCCESS (0.012 secs / 0.009 secs)`
